This is the AmigaOS4.x version of Analog Cheap Disk.

None of the original code was used, to recreate this, only the art work and music,
initially was going to convert assembler code, but decided there it was more work than it was worth, 
copper list, and emulation that makes no sense, when there nothing in this music disk that requires any parallax 
or any special amiga chipset features.

Instead I use hardware composition of modern graphic card to keep the CPU usage relatively low.

The logo, from the art work I got the impression that the bobbles should be moving, 
So I cleaned up logo and made the bobbles move.

Thanks to Arnaud Guyon for making this public.
As for the rest of credit look in the scroll text.

For the code I decided to use MIT, as most of code snippets are under MIT license from before, in other project. 
Apache License does only apply to any original work, like graphics and music, and apply to names.

Problems: vu meters not working, due to missing features in ptreplay.library, maybe I can work around it with different library.

Other ideas, stuff to do:
Fullscreen, Iconify, Tooltypes, Outro
there is no outro on the original, but I think make a lot more interesting.
